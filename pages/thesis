<i>Abstract:</i>
<blockquote>Personal servers are an attractive concept: People carry around a
  device that takes care of computing, storage and communication on
  their behalf in a pervasive computing environment. So far personal
  servers have mainly been considered for accessing personal
  information. In this paper, we consider personal servers in the
  context of a digital key system. Digital keys are an interesting
  alternative to physical keys for mail or good delivery companies whose
  employees access tens of private buildings every day. In this paper,
  we present a digital key system tailored for the current incarnation
  of personal servers, i.e., a Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone. We
  describe how to use Bluetooth for this application, we present a
  simple authentication protocol and we provide a detailled analysis of
  response time and energy consumption on the mobile phone.
