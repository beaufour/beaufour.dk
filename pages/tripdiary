<h1>Diary</h1>
<h2>18/11</h2>
<p>
Montreal. Eating out with Nannas friends from the conference. Crashed
Erics hotel room at the Fairmont.
</p>

<h2>19/11</h2>
<p>
Montreal. Sightseeing in awfull weather. Rain and wind. Checked in to
hostel: Alternative Backpackers, Rue St. Pierre. Dinner in Chinatown.
</p>
<p>
The guy on the bunk bed next to us was snorring _ALL_ night. Well, did
not bother me that much, but Nanna did not sleep much.
</p>

<h2>20/11</h2>
<p>
Rented a Toyota Echo from Thrifty (cheapest deal we could find). Drove
to Ville de Quebec. Sightseeing in the old part of town, saw the
Citadelle and the old fort, etc. Dinner in a "Restaurant Breton".
</p>
<p>
Stayed at l'Auberge de la Paix, Rue C??.
</p>
<h2>21/11</h2>
<p>
Went cruising on lesser roads towards Ottawa. Had lunch in Restaurant
Bravo in a small town called Grand Mere (Grandmom).
</p>
<p>
Watched the sunset at Oka, and found a Bed and Breakfast on the way:
Auberge David, St. Andre-Est. Very nice and cozy place. Dinner at the
guesthouse.

<h2>22/11</h2>
<p>
Nice fruit salad (with almoundsauce...?), homemade french pancakes and
homemade marmelade, mmmmmm!
</p>
<p>
Small walk in St. Andre-Est, then onwards towards Ottawa. Stopped in
Montebello to look at a "log-castle" -- nothing much to see.
</p>
<p>
Found Ottawa. Did sightseeing and had a (free) guided tour at the
parlament. Saw the Peace Tower with some smelly french-speakers. Had
dinner at The Highlander, a Scottish pub, and hung out there a couple
of hours. Heard some live music (The Diplomats), had haggish, whiskey,
beer, Irish Coffee and White Russians (of course). Had to give up
around 22 -- too jetlagged.
</p>
<p>
Stayed at Ottawa Backpackers, York Street. What a Hippie-place. Had a
"semi-private" room, which was a room with a curtain as a door. Many
other of the same type of rooms in the same basement. Also included a
housecat.
</p>

<h2>23/11</h2>
<p>
Of towards Toronto. Drove down Thousand Islands Parkway. Visited Quinte's Isle and saw Point Petre (disapointing) and The Sandbanks.
</p>
<p>
Walked around Toronto. Had dinner at Tasty 168 (?). Had a very weird
drink with "pearls": Mint Sherbert w/pearls. The pearls was some kind
of extract from sweet potatoes and something else.... not that
recommendable.
</p>
<p>
Stayed at Global Backpackers, King Street.
</p>

<h2>24/11</h2>
<p>
Sightseeing in Toronto. University of Toronto. Found free internet
access at a university library :). In the afternoon it got very cold and started to rain ..... brrrrrr.
</p>
<p>
Tried to find Little Italy. Did not succeed (in anything else than
getting very cold).
</p>

<h2>25/11</h2>
<p>
Saw the CN Tower (cannot remember the height, but the brag a lot about
it). Offered a splendid view of Toronto. Manned myself up to standing
on the Glass Floor, with a direct view downwards (200 meters+ I
think). Uuuuh.
</p>
<p>
Visited Allan Gardens -- a park with nothing to it, except for the
name :). Also passed by the Bata Shoe Museum, just to be able to say
that I was near :)
</p>

<p>
Three German dudes had moved into our room at the hostel: Daniel, Tim
and Andre. They studied in Milwaukee, and was touring around US and
Canada for two weeks in a WV bus (of course). We went out eating with
them, and got pretty drunk at the hostel bar later. I played a
miniature-tabletennis drinking game -- quite fun. Got a nice Moosehead
(canadian beer) for participating in the event.
</p>

<p>
A not about canadiens: They were not lying in Southpark, when they
joked about the pronounciation of 'ou' :) 'About' is pronounced quite
funny. They also say 'Jaaah', as a sort of 'Yeah' (like in the movie,
Fargo). They also use 'you guys' no matter if there are girls in a
group (may be a general north american treat, I do not know).
</p>

<h2>26/11</h2>
<p>
On the road again, towards Niagara Falls. A little hung over :).
</p>
<p>
Saw the falls. Quite nice! Just to do it, we also went to the
U.S. side. That was more difficult than we imagined. We had to fill
out misc. imigration forms, and wait for some time, be "interrogated"
by a custom office why we wanted to go into the US: "The Canadians
have the better view, why go to the U.S.??". Also cost $6/person to
enter U.S.... But but, it was nice to visit Goat Island, and The Three
Sisters, which are Islands located more or less directly in the falls
on the U.S. side.
</p>
<p>
We then drove towards Buffalo in search of a random motel, also did a
small tour of Lackawanna (small town south of Bufallo), but we never
succeeded in finding a motel... weird. Oh well, back to Canada, and we
found a motel in no time. The Rex Motel, on McLeod Road.
</p>
<p>
We then saw Niagara Falls by night. They overdo their lightning shows
a bit. The falls looked like a giant multicolored marshmellow... they
had also plastered the town with a lot of "light-sculptures" with
Disney cartoons.... funny, but mostly ugly.
</p>

<h2>27/11</h2>
<p>
Off to the north, to Algonquin Provincial Park, raining all the
time. Stopped in Orillia for lunch.
</p>
<p>
We arrived in the park in the afternoon, and did a small tour to
Ragged Falls before settling down at the Wolfden Bunkhouse. A nice
cabin a few kilometers from the park, with plenty of room, especially
since we were the only guests. The "caretakers" were a couple around
our age: Claire &amp; Darryl.
</p>
<p>
We forgot to shop in one of the "big" towns on the way though, so we
shopped at a very small minimart. Pasta and ready-made pastasauce
(that day, and the rest of the stay at the cabin).
</p>

<h2>28/11</h2>
<p>
Did a hike around Mizzy Lake in the park, 11 km, took us a bit over 5
hours. It was a very beautiful trip, although a bit cold, it snowed
almost all the time. We did not really see any animals besides birds
and squirrels (which are everywhere here, all the parks in the towns
have plenty of them). We did see a lot of tracks though... so we were
probably top noisy. Also tried to howl to get answers from wolves --
no answer :( But on the way back we did see a moose in the roadside!!
</p>

<p>
On the way back the road was extremely slippy and I got to practise
how to get the car back on track after it skidded... a bit _too funny_
with a car comming against us in the opposite direction. But I did it
correctly -- thanks rally games :) The weather also had influence on
the power supply which was a bit flaky... but it did not really bother
us.
</p>

<h2>29/11</h2>
<p>
Wow! What a lot of snow. It had snowed around 30 cms that
night. Everything was covered in snow. But it was a clear sky, so a
very beautiful day was ahead of us. We rented some snowshoes (quite
fun!) and did a hike to Ragged Falls again, and then I did another
hike on a trail near the Wolfden. Without a map, I was a bit worried
about getting back before dark... but it was a good hike. I was
completely dead afterwards.
</p>

<h2>30/11</h2>
<p>
Enough of snow and hikes, so we returned the snowshoes (almost forgot
though) and drove through the park (1 hour drive). Out of the park, I
found out that I had forgotten my shoes at the Wolfden. Great. Back
again. But but, we then saw a couple of beavers on the way and the
visitor center was also open, so we visited that on the way back.
</p>
<p>
We found a motel in Rigaud, a small town not far from Quebec. Found
some chinese take away food and a couple of beers :)
</p>

<h2>1/12</h2>
<p>
Drove to Montreal, where we visited the Biodome. A "zoo" with three
different climate zones and lots of animals. Nice. I discovered that
Gentoo is a penguin species (Linux nerd thing) :)
</p>
<p>
We then returned the car and found Alternative Backpackers again (on
Rue St. Pierre). No snorring guy this time, only the normal alarm
clocks that people but on snooze (grrrr!).
</p>

<h2>2/12</h2>
<p>
Oh boy, it really is cold in Canada... We just wandered around and
looked at some shops (inside a shopping mall). In the evening we went
to see an NHL Icehockey match: Montreal Canadiens vs. Tampa Bay
Lightning. Montreal won 3-2! Great fun! It was also "Bobblehead
Night", and both Nanna and I won a "Andrei Markov Bobblehead
Figure". Wait fo the pictures :) Great souvenir!
</p>

<h2>3/12</h2>
<p>
Wee, up at 5 o'clock. Off towards sunny and warm New Zeland. Missed
the shuttle bus by 2 minutes, so I had to wait for an half hour but
made it to the airport in good time. Had a good chat about Linux
distributions Redhat vs. Mandrake with the U.S. Customs official, we
even touched the subject of kernel versions :) He ended up saying
"Live the revolution!" :)
</p>
<p>
First stop was L.A. Seven hours of waiting in "the town of
smog". Promised myself I would never live there... damn it is smogged
up city. Oh well, sat in the lounge and sipped coffe and biscuits
while reading my book for more or less the whole time. Also read some
interesting stuff about how to keep up life with as little as 3-4
hours a sleep each night in some magazine, usnig Provigil ... hmmmm,
something right up Pink's alley I think :)
</p>
<p>
Well got into the plane and sat next to a Welsh couple. Nice people,
but not the easiest accent to understand...
</p>

<h2>4/12</h2>
<p>
Hmm, where did that day go? I thought I saw it somewhere! But no, you
didn't. I passed the dateline on the way, so bye bye 4/12...
</p>

<h2>5/12</h2>
<p>
Arrived at Auckland 5.30, and got on the plane to Wellingtno
7:30. Arrived on schedule and met Tina and Catja in the airport. Went
back to their house and met the rest of the "danish league": Anne,
Kristina og Flemming.
</p>

<p>
SMS'ed (or TEXT'ed in kiwi-speak) with Eske &amp; Marika, and met up with
them in downtown Wellington. A bit fun to meet them on the other side
of the world. I touristed with them in Wellington: Saw Te Papa (museum
in Wellington) and rode the cable car. The museum was huge and very
interesting. I was a bit too jetlagged to have quite the right
concentration for 100% museum-browsing :)
</p>

<p>
Finished the evening up with beer and pizza back at the house. Eske &amp;
Marika crashed there for the night too. Broke the time record for
falling asleep -- had been awake for far too many hours.
</p>

<h2>6/12</h2>
<p>
I travel to the other side of the world, and get invited to: A danish
christmas dinner (julefrokost). The danish society held it. In the
senior citizens club in Petone -- the place says somethnig about the
general age of the attendants :) But it was fun, and all the other
"danish food"-starving folks were in heaven :)
</p>

<p>
After the julefrokost, we went to the local pub in Johnsonville:
Jays. Had a good time, except that it seems to be my fate to "be
attacked by locals". A _big_ and _very_ drunk kiwi sat down at our
table and tried to chat. Did not understand much of what he said, but
he did check if the girls "were available", understood that. But he
thought I was a swell guy ... Catja and me tried to escape from him on
the dancefloor. The old toilet trick did not work, another (more
friendly and relaxed) kiwi started a conversation there. Got rid of
him eventually, and we did have a good evening!
</p>

<h2>7/12</h2>
<p>
Cruised around Wellington with Tina &amp; Chris. Saw the inner city, the
Museum of City &amp; Sea, and hiked up Mt. Victoria. What a view, and it
was very sunny! Cool.
</p>

<p>
Went to see <i>Love Actually</i> at the cinema in the evening. Okay
movie, had some good laughs and twists. Got a bit to cheasy in the end
though.
</p>

<p>
I also got myself a local NZ SIM-card for my phone. Makes travelling a
lot easier, when you have a phone at hand at all times. Amazing what
you can do with modern (and compatible) technology. :)
</p>

<h2>8/12</h2>
<p>
With the help of one of Tinas colleagues I got a good deal for a
rental car, and got myself a Mazda Family for 11 days. A lot of room
for one guy :) Started with a quick tour to a local beach with Tina,
and then off towards Napier. Did not make it to the dolphine swim, so
I just cruised the city quickly and scanned the Art Deco buildings,
and then went straight for Taupo.
</p>

<p>
Stopped at a waterfall on the way and had a chat with an Australian
wine producer :) Arrived at Burke's Backpackers at Spa Road, nice
place. Did a small evening walk in Taupo before going to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Got a feel of the NZ driving. Twisting roads with one lane in each
direction. Kiwis do not drive much more than the allowed 100 km/h, but
they do the corners as fast as they can... it is not unusual to see a
car packed with a whole family to do a corner with screeching
tires. Well, the french blood in my veins probably helps there :)
Driving in the left side does not pose big problems, although I have
wipe my windscreen a couple of times when I had to turn :)
</p>

<p>
The only twist is their right of way when you do a left turn, and
somebody is doing a right turn down the same road (comming from the
opposite direction than you): Surprise surprise, you have to give way!
Has only remembered it too late both times it has happened to me as of
yet, just avoidnig a crash both times. Who invented that rule?? Oh
well, next time I will remember (I hope).
</p>

<h2>9/12</h2>
<p>
Because of bad weather conditions the Tongariro crossing was closed
(should be the best one day hike in NZ). :( A bit of a bad start. But
but it soon got better. Instead I arranged for a three hour "Adventure
tour" on a 4x4 motorcycle (a quadbike). It turned out that it was only
me and the guide (Dave, I think). WAS THAT FUN? Oh yeah! That was
three hours of great great fun. A mix of driving at top speed on
logging roads and hillsides (with sheep all around), and twisting and
turning on small "paths" in the forest. Up and down, over fallen
trees, through mud pools, etc.! Fun fun fun! I can highly recommend
that! The company I used was Great Lakes 4W Bike, as far as I
remember.
</p>

<p>
Well, got dropped of at the wharf in Taupo, and enjoyed a Lakeside
Burger: Minced lamb, mint, onions, beethroot, tomato, salad. Yummi!
Never had a lamb burger before, also highly recommendable. Maybe it was influenced by the rush of 4W-driving still though :)
</p>

<p>
Continued the days with a cruise on Lake Taupo on "The Barbary". A
nice sailing boat, allegedly previously owned by Errol Flynn. Quite a
skipper -- Barbary Bill! Talked about logging wood in Hj&oslash;rring
and living in Fuglebakken. A man of the world with a good sense of
humour! All in all a nice trip on the lake, where we also saw the
Maori carvings in the wall.
</p>

<p>
Bought some lamb chops in the supermarket: 300g = NZ$4 (about 16
Dkr.)! I wish lamb were as cheap as that in Denmark! Tasted damn good
too! Finished a very good day by going to the local (backpacker) pub,
Mulligans, with Zack(arias) a dutch girl (with two sisters that also
had boys names....) and James (and english guy). The pub reminded me
of a High School party, but it was okay fun to have a beer there.
</p>

<h2>10/12</h2>
<p>
Bad weather, again, so crossing still closed. Droved up north instead,
and saw Wai-O-Tapu -- "Thermal Wonderland". A very big thermal area,
with a geyser and lots of hot water and mud pools. Quite a lot bigger
than the areas I saw in Iceland. And the Champagne Pool was an
incredible sight -- what colors! It was raining all the time, so I did
get quite soaked.
</p>

<p>
After "Thermal Wonderland", I went to a small town called Matamata to
visit the only remaining movie set from Lord of the Rings: The
Hobbiton Set. Although rather steep priced (NZ$50), I think it was
worth it. Got some "making of" trivia, saw Hobbiton with party tree,
Bag End, etc. The set is not untouched though, there are only 17
hobbit holes left, and the fronts are not there anymore. But still
quite fun/interesting to see. Rained some of the time here also...
</p>

<p>
After that I drove a bit south again, and visited The Polynesian Spa
in Rotorua. A thermal bath. Not very big, but nice and relaxing, and
the "stuff" in the water (all green and a bit smelly) was probably
good for something :)
</p>

<p>
Ended the night with a chat about travelling with a canadian and dutch
girl from my room. Did get tempted to take a longer trip, where my
iteniary is not as strict as now. "Well, I was only supposed to be
there 2-3 days, but stayed a month." On a tropical island, off the
coast of Australia. Sounds nice, eh?
</p>

<h2>11/12</h2>
<p>
Still bad weather, no crossing. Stayed long enough in Taupo, moved on
northwards towards Mt. Maunganui, stopping to see the Huka Falls on
the way. And wow! There was sun in Mt. Maunganui. Almost like being in
another country :) Walked up Mt. Maunganui in very nice weather, and
walked along the beach. Mmmmm, sun is good :)
</p>

<p>
I then drove to Hahei Beach, further up north (on the Coromandel
peninsula). Arrived just in time to be able to try a bit of "hotwater
beach". A couple of hours each day (tide dependent) you can dig down
20-30 cm in the sand and make your own hot pool. Quite a weird
experience to have your feet in _very_ hot water, while the cool ocean
water waves come rolling in... After that I had a nice swim in the
ocean.
</p>

<p>
Stayed at "Hahei Holiday Resort/Cathedral Cove Backpackers". Nicely
located right at the beach, but on a campground. Not too cosy, but
okay.
</p>

<h2>12/12</h2>
<p>
Started the day with a morning walk to Cathedral Cove, a cove/cave
right next to the beach. Nature does create many strange things.
</p>

<p>
Drove further up north on the peninsula. Stopped at Whitianga for
breakfast. Quite aweird to sit on a beach in t-shirt and shorts eating
fresh strawberries and fresh orangejuice in the middle of December! I
then drove on, stopping for a break at Whangapoua. A small town on the
coast: What a fantastic place. Quiet and isolated, fantatic view and
beaches. Also stopped to enjoy the view at Maungataururu on the
way. "Just a viewpoint" along the highway, there a plenty, but what a
view!
</p>

<p>
Drove through Colville, and all the way up to Fletcher's Bay. An hours
drive on a very narrow gravel road right next to the ocean. A very
nice drive up there, lots of beautifull views of the hills and the
ocean! The drive was not for the faint at heart though. There is not
much room, and you do meet cars going the other way from time to
time. But it is certainly worth it.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at Fletcher's Bay I took a short hike up the
hills. Okay, but nothing special. I then found out two things: (1)
There was no room in the hostel there (more or less the only thing
there, by the way) and (2) I was not allowed to drive there with my
rental car. The first was okay, but the second thing was probably not
too smart (do not tell the rental company!). Oh well, went back again,
enjoying the view again. Went on to Thames, and stayed there of the
night.
</p>

<p>
Found out that somebody had rammed my side mirror. Fuck! Oh well, not
much to do about it. I guess I have to pay for that when I return the
car. :( Merde.
</p>

<p>
Stayed at ACB backpackers. An old hotel. Rather boring place, with
"weird types" hanging out. Not really recommendable.
</p>

<h2>13/12</h2>
<p>
Started the day with a trip to Kaugeranga Forest Park, right next to
Thames. Had breakfast at "Outlook 76", and then did a hike up to a
peak called "The Pinnacles" (759 meters). Oh boy, quite a lot of
_stairs_. The last part, from a hut to the summit, was first extremely
slippery and then afterwards resembled mountain climbing more than
hiking: Extremely steep! But it was sure worth it, it wa a fantastic
view from up there. Had lunch up there, all by myself. Had a nice
Zen-touch to it :) The hike took about 4 hours all in all.
</p>

<p>
I then drove to Auckland, and after some "motorway-fun" (because I did
not look at the map..) I found Auckland Central Backpackers on Queen
Street. A very big, but nice place, with internet cafe, bar, lounge,
travel centre, etc. It did take three requests before I got clean
sheets though...
</p>

<p>
I then walked a bit around Auckland, before going to the bar for a few
beers. When I got up to the room though, I found another guy sleeping
the my bed. Hmm. There was another free bed though, so I took that
one.
</p>

<h2>14/12</h2>
<p>
A bit hung over... had breakfat on the habour front, before going
sailing on the NZL41. A two hour sailing trip on a former America's
Cup Boat. Quite fun. Lot's of "grinding", that is manual work to
trim/adjust the sails. Cruised around 10 knots. Also got to steer the
boat for a while.
</p>

<p>
I then went to "Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World", an aquarium with a
walk-through glass tunnel. The glas tunnel was okay, have not tried
that before. Loads of fish, stingrays, turtles and sharks. But what
was much more interesting was a very big section about the South
Pole. A recreation of Soctt's hut, and loads of information about the
expeditions, and current work and projects there. If you are in to the
South Pole, this is certainly worth a visit!
</p>

<p>
I then went to the Sky Tower -- Auckland's "high tower". 200+
meters. It was easier for me to stand on the glass floor this time (as
opposed to the CN Tower ni Toronto), but it was still a quite weird
feeling. Thought about doing a "Skyjump", a jump from the tower and
down towards the roads beneath. Not bungy, on a wire with
counterweights slowing you down. But opted out, too crazy.
</p>

<p>
I then went back to the hostel and found out that the bed I had slept
in was in fact someone else's... he aparently got in from town quite
late, saw me lying there and went back to town :) Hmm, they must have
overbooked the room, because there were not free beds. Oh well,
somebody moved out so I got a free bed this night :)
</p>

<p>
Went to see Matrix Revolutions in the evening. Not too fantastic, but
it had some cool scenes.
</p>

<h2>15/12</h2>
<p>
Spent a lot of time writing my diary :) Then I went out into the rain
to see some of the rest of Auckland. Got quite discouraged by the rain
though, so I had a cup of coffee and read my book instead. I then did
some shopping and got myself a nice new backpack (including a a drink
bag, extremely recommendable). Bought both at Kathmandu, a cool
outdoor shop with a lot of good stuff and a Christmas sale (50% off on
a lot of stuff). I also got some cool Quicksilver shorts to go with
the season and the location :)
</p>

<p>
I then fetched my rainproof car and did some last sightseeing "on
wheels" of Auckland, and then headed up towards Pahia, further up
north.
</p>

<p>
Pahia is quite a holiday town. Beaches, sailing trips, warm weather,
etc. Very nice, albeit very touristy. I checked in to The Saltwater
Lodge, which is by far the fanciest hostel I have been to yet. The
4-person room I was in had own fridge, shower/toilet and tv. It also
had a huge common veranda with a view of the bay! Al very new and
shiny. Recommendable (NZ$ 25/night). Only bad thing was the squeky
bunkbeds :)
</p>

<p>
I then went down to the nearest bar to have a burger (got a coupon
from the hostel), and then on to the hostels own bar to get a night
cap. It was karaoke night... oh boy, people cannot sing, but try
anyway. :( But in the breaks they showed _classic- musicvideos: Snap -
The Power, and Bobby Brown with something I cannot remember. Very
classic. Saved the night :).
</p>

<h2>16/12</h2>
<p>
Took an all-day bus tour to Cape Reinga (almost as far north as you
can come on the North Island). At first I thought I had chosen the
wrong company as all other people from the hostel took other
companies, and my bus was filled with old people. A bit depressed
untill I found out at the first stop (all busses take the same route,
more or less) that the average age on all busses was just about the
same, not much difference.
</p>

<p>
The trip started with a tour up the "Ninety Mile Beach", which is not
ninety mile but more like 90 kilometers long. Nice try, but no cigar
:) You drivedirectly _on the beach_, which is very long and flat and
which is _and official state highway_. Fun to try, and weird to have a
beach as an official highway. Especially because you have to be
careful with the tide (as it makes the beach unaccessible). We then
headed eastwards into some giant sanddunes and grabbed some
boogieboards and went "surfing" down the dunes with speeds around
40-50 km/t. Very fun, although you get sand allover. The busdriver
(who was in his mid sixties) showed how it should be done in style!!
He was the fastest of us all. Cool dude. We then went up to Cape
Reinga, which is a bit like Skagen, as you see two seas meet. Here it
is just: The Tasman Seand and The Pacific Ocean. A beautiful place if
you are into "weird" nature. We then went back, and stopped at various
places of interest. One of them was "The Ancient Kauri Kingdom" (what
a name...), a Kauri-tree souvenir shop with a cafeteria, very touristy
but they did have a spiral staircase cut out of a _very large_ Kauri
tree trunk. Fascinating.
</p>

<p>
Back at the hostel I met Gregor from Hungary who was touring New
Zealand onn a BMW touring motorcycle. Not very envious I am, no no :)
I then met Josh from Boston, U.S. and we went down the the bar from
last night and met up with some people he had met earlier: Tim &amp;
Andrea from Buffalo and Paul &amp; Shannon from Ireland. Funny people. Had
a lot of beer with them. Funny to meet people from Buffalo, as I had
just driven through there. They said that there was not much to see
there, but it was a good party town, and we should have tried the
"Buffalo Chicken Wings". :)
</p>

<h2>17/12</h2>
<p>
Started the day with a Bay of Islands cruise (the bay where Pahia
lies). A half-day trip around to see some of the many islands in the
bay. It goes all the way to an island with a hole in it, called
(tada!) "Hole in the rock". The boat also sailed through the hole. Not
too much room to manouver in, but I guess the skipper has tried it
before :)
</p>

<p>
I got of in Russel, a small town opposite of Pahia across the
bay. "Romantic Russel" is their slogan, "Sleepy Russel" could go as
well. Not much to see and do, just a sleep little town. Took the nice
little ferry back to Pahia.
</p>

<p>
Back in Pahia I started realizing that it was well over 3 o'clock, and
I had to be in Waitomo Caves the day after at 9:00am where I had
booked a trip to see a glowworm cave. Hmmm, that was more than 500km
from Pahia. Ooops. Oh well, it is not the first time I have driven
long distances to in behind the wheel and kiwi-style driving
downthere. I stopped to see the Tane Mahuta, the biggest Kauri tree in
New Zealand (and then also in the world I guess); Girth: 13m, height:
55m, age: around 2000 years.
</p>

<p>
I arrived without any problems on the way at 10:15pm at "Big Bird Bed
&amp; Breakfast". Long day. Recommendable place, giant room nice
facilities and Ross &amp; Ann seems like nice folks. Only NZ$40,
incl. breakfast.
</p>

<h2>18/12</h2>
<p>
Had a nice sleep in my own room (aaah) and had a nice breakfast at the
B&amp;B. Found out why it was called "Big Bird B&amp;B": They have
ostriches :)
</p>

<p>
I then drove down to The Blackwater Rafting Co. nearby, and met up
with the rest of the group going down the caves. We got fitted into
wetsuits, helmest, headlamps and harnesses and then went up to the
entrance where we first practiced some abseiling (rapelling). Then we
abseiled down a dark and narrow hole in the ground (around 35 m),
arriving deep inside a cave. Coool! We then had a small walk before
going "flying" on wire in total darkness above the water inside the
cave. The only lights were from glowworms in the cave
ceiling. Glowworms are small worms that sit still on the ceiling and
glow to attract insects.
</p>

<p>
We then got some inner tubes (from tires) and jumped down in very cold
and dark water, where we had just seen big eels swim around --
eeew. We then cruised around walking, swimming or on our tubes and
watched the amazing cave and the enourmous amount of glowworms. Very
weird experience, and very beautiful. We then had to walk/crawl our
way through some narrow tunnels and up three waterfalls before
reaching the outside again. A cool trip! Took 5 hours all in all, with
approx. 3 hours in the cave.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the groups was: Paul, Dave, Michal, Adele, Greg, Alex
&amp; Penny.  Guides: Angus &amp; Louisa.
</p>

<p>
I then drove down to Turangi (close to Lake Taupo, but further
south). I stayed at Extreme Backpackers, and at last (and luckily) the
weather was supposed to be very good for the Tongariro Crossing the
day after. So I booked a bus to and from the hike.
</p>

<h2>19/12</h2>
<p>
Up early, and off with the bus at 7:30am. The crossing was very
beautiful, at times it was like walking on the moon. A lot of craters
and weird colors (from volcanic/thermal acticity). The weather was
perfect for the first "interesting part" of the hike, and only got a
bit cloudy on the last half. The first part is by far the most
interesting, I found the last half rather boring, and way to manicured
at places.
</p>

<p>
As I had to catch the early bus, to get to Wellington in "early" (as
in before 11pm), I did not dare to climb any of the mountains. The
trip was stated to take around 7-8 hours, which was around the time to
catch the early bus. It only took me 5h15, with plenty of breaks. Hmm,
could easily have climbed on of the peaks. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
I then waited two hours for the bus (it was on schedule, I was just
ahead of time). Then it was of towards Wellington. That was no
problem, but then I had to find the car rental company, which took a
bit longer. When I fetched the car I was driven there by a friend of
Tina, and Tina guided me back to the house, so I did not really notice
the way to or from there. I found it though, after some driving
around. Cleaned the car, and took a cab to the house. The house was
very empty, but open, so I got in and crashed in the bed around
10:30pm.
</p>

<h2>20/12</h2>
<p>
The day we left for Wellington. Spent the morning packing the car. A
"Piggyvan" from "Piggy Backpackers". A rebulit For Econovan, with just
enough room for us and the luggage -- but it was loaded! With the
amount of luggage we had to get all our stuff out of the car each
nihgt, as two people would be sleeping inside the car.
</p>
<p>
We then headed towards the Bluebridge ferry, and the 3h trip in the
Cook Strait towards the South Island. Very nice, but grey weather all
the way. When we arrived we drove towards Kaikoura, the whale and
dolphin watching capital :)
</p>

<p>
Straightaway we went to book a trip to go swimming with dolphins, but
found out that they were booked until mid-January :( Damn it, but I
expected that. Have to swim with dolphins another day then. Instead we
booked half a day of whale watching for the day after.
</p>

<p>
We then found a nice little camp ground and set up our piggyvan for
the first time. Oh wee, a bit troublesome to move all the luggage from
the trunk to the front seats -- and we had to do that each new
place. Damn, but nothing to do about it. But besides from that it was
quite easy to put up the tent. Tina &amp; Catja had also brought a
(normal) tent, and as it was easier we slept in that.
</p>

<p>
We did not do much that day other than eat at Subways :) We also
watched a fantastic sunset from the camp site. Sometimes with the
right combination of clouds and the sun sunsets can be stunning --
this was one of the occasions. We also had the added bonus of a couple
of mountains in the background :)
</p>

<p>
We stayed at 69 Beach Road Camping.
</p>

<p>
After two weeks I am able to give a quick introductions to Kiwispeak
:) It is quite like english, but they use the word "heaps" quite a
lot; "There were heaps of people", "Do you have money?" "Heaps!". They
also use "as" as an ending to something, like "hard as" if something
is hard, or "sweet as", "scary as", "wet as". "I am telling you mate,
it was hard as!!". Sweet is also used instead of cool: "I've brought
heaps of beer" "Sweet!!". They also tend to use "cheers" and "mate"
quite a lot, but that is a common british trait I
guess. Pronunciation-wise the most distingtive is their funny
"e"-sounds. Theys seem to "stress" it, so tent is "teent" not
pronounced like "teen" but somewhere inbetween a normal "e" and
"ee". It is heard in many words, but commonly in "tent", "bench",
"seven". Funny as :)
</p>

<h2>21/12</h2>
<p>
New Zealand, sunshine, warm weather, summer, water, vacation -- some
of these keywords made us go to the beach for a morning swim. But uoh
the water is cold in Kiwiland!! I did take a swim or two, but it was
very very cold. The others were quite the chickens and only went in
and out in 5 secs. On the way back it moreover got cloudy and
cold. Not the best morning swim...
</p>

<p>
We then went on the boat to (hopefully) see some whales. We were
_very_ lucky and saw three sperm whales, heaps of dolphins, fur seals,
a shark and a couple of albatrosses (I think of John Cleese every time
I hear "albatross"...). Very very lucky, and a very special feeling to
watch the majestic whales, even though you only see their back and
blowhole. The water was a bit rough though, and the boat was a
catamaran. Even I got a bit weird stomac. But not near a lot of others
who spent most of the trip puking in the back of the boat :(
</p>

<p>
After a good whalewatching trip, we went home and had dinner and
played yatzy.
</p>

<h2>22/12</h2>
<p>
We got up very early to see the sunrise (as we hoped it could live up
to the sunset we saw the first day). It could not, the sun was behind
a lot of clouds, and it was very cold!! Hmmm, summer is not
necessarily warm in New Zealand.
</p>

<p>
We then packed our van and got on the road towards Hanmer Springs (on
the road towards Christchurch). There we went to their thermal pools
and had agame of minigolf (do not play against Catja, she is a
pro). We also visited the nearby maze, for kids but we had fun for 5
minutes.
</p>

<p>
We then drove towards Christchurch and hoped to find a stay to sleep
on the way. And we in fact did in the Balmoral Forest. It was a $5
camp ground. It only had cold water and toilets, but for $5 for the
whole car for the night we were on it! Quite nice, and there should be
heaps of these sites around NZ.
</p>

<h2>23/12</h2>
<p>
Packed the car and drove to Christchurch. After some searching we
found a parking spot and met up with Chris (Tina's boyfriend). Chris followed us for the rest of the trip -- one more in the car...</p>

<p>
We then sightsee'd the best we could and wandered a bit around;
Cathedral square, the canal, the botanic gardens, etc. A very english
city. I succeeded in missing the others by 10 mins, and had to find
out how to get to the campsite by bus. No problem had it not been for
the confusing signs and a huge queue at the tourist information. I
eventually got home to the camp though, only 1,5 hours later. Oh well..
</p>

<p>
Back at the camp we made a plan for the rest of the trip, and made
some bookings for some of the stuff we wanted to do. We got most of
it, but the overnight cruise on Milford Sound that we wanted was sold
out :( We also decided to do a skydive further on -- what exactly went
through my mind? I must still have been jetlagged :)
</p>

<p>
With Chris as part of the "holiday package" the sleeping arrangements
was that Chris and Tina slept in the (normal) tent, Carsten and Kate
in the back of the van, and Catja and I in "army beds" in the
tent-part of the van. Not much room, but enough.
</p>

<p>
We stayed at the Top 10 Meadow Park at Main North Road. Ok place.
</p>

<h2>24/12</h2>
<p>
Christmas day! Well for us, the kiwis could not care less they
celebrate christmas the 25th in the morning. We started the day by a
2-3 hour horseback ride through smoe forest and on the beach. Oh wee,
it was a while since I last sat on a horse. It went nice, the horse
was a bit lazy and clumsy -- just like me :) The ride itself was a bit
booring though, we trotted along at slow speed in a long line for
almost the entire trip. We also did some canter -- never got the
rythm, my riding skills need a fresh up. "A sack of potatos" fitted me
nicely. After the ride my thighs and bum was also quite used -- auch.
</p>

<p>
After the ride the others dropped me off at the "Antarctic Visitors
Centre" and went to shop for the chrismas dinner. The centre is highly
recommendable if you are into the southpole-business. They have all
sorts of stuff about the current research and living conditions on the
southpole, and lots of information about the flora and fauna. Trivia:
Body hair grows at double speed in the antarctic :) They also had an
icestorm simulator where they created an icestorm you could stand in
-- quite cold. They also had an "Antarctic Handbook" used by everybody
that goes to the antarctic with camping and emergency procedures,
etc. Very interesting, but unfortunately you could not buy it :(
</p>

<p>
There was no bus directly from the centre to the camp site, so I had
to take a bus to the centre first and then a bus to the camp site :(
While I was waiting for the bus I thought that I could just as well
try to hitch a ride. Good idea, after 10-15 minutes an old chap (80)
stops and gives me a ride: He lives 200 meters from the camp site and
is on the way home. How lucky can you be? I get some kiwi-beer tips
and finds out that his grandfather was danish. It is a small and weird
world we live in.
</p>

<p>
In the evening we celebrated christmas (and washed clothes). Weird to
barbecue outside on christmas eve... I had some nice lamb chops. We
then exchanged presents. I got a cool t-shirt and cap from Tina &amp;
Catja, and Katrine had given me a present before leavnig Denmark: A
small bottle of Gammel Dansk! Coool!
</p>

<p>
We then gambled for a lot of $2 packages and ended the night with a
waterfight with Tinas new watergun and a swordfight with my golfclubs
(plastic). Weird but fun Christmas.
</p>

<h2>25/12</h2>
<p>
Chris and Tina went to see Chris' grandmother at the hospital and the
rest of us went sightseeing around Christchurch. We went to Lyttleton
and Ferrymead: Both boring.
</p>

<p>
We then drove towards Queenstown, with some stops along the way at
Lake Tekapo and Lake Punaki on the way, beautiful views!
</p>

<p>
We arrived in Queenstown and found a campsite at Kawarau Falls, just
outside Queenstown, and what a view. We camped right next to the
Kawarau river, and had a beautiful view over the lake. The background
was The Remarkables mountain range: Very impressive and the ones used
as Mordor in LOTR!
</p>

<p>
We steayd at the Kawarau Falls Camping.
</p>

<h2>26/12</h2>
<p>
We relaxed in the morning, and had booked a jetboat ride on the
Kawarau River at 14:00. They fucked up quite a bit with our booking,
and we got off by 15:15. Oh well, the ride was quite fun. It is fast,
and they know how to handle the boat. You get quite close to the
surroundings, and quite wet! We debated a lot with the manager
afterwards and in the end he gave in and we one of us got to ride
free. They were forgiven.
</p>

<p>
We then walked around Queenstown for a while. It is purely a tourist
town. Nothing to see. But it is certainely a mekka for adventure
stuff: Rafting, skydives, riding, mountainbiking, bungi, fly-by-wire,
canyon swing, helicopter rides, etc. You name it, they got it.
</p>

<h2>27/12</h2>
<p>
Rafting day! Four of us had booked a rafting trip on the Shotover
River. We got geared up in wetsuits and helmets, got ni a bus and was
taken to the river on the hairrising Skipper Canyon Road: It is an old
very narrow mining road high up ni the mountains. And what did they
use to fix it: horse-shit.... Oh well, we made it (as tons of tourists
do each day) and was put in a boat with two american girls (Andrea and
Clara?) and and agentinianan guy (Amelio). Our rafting guide was
called Johno. He said he was a microbiologist but was fed up with
working in a lab. You can call that a careerchange.
</p>

<p>
The river was grade 2 to 4! It took 2-3 hours, but the action only
lasted a few minutes. But it was very beautiful and very fun! The
rapids had charming names as f.x. Jaws and Toilet :) The american
girls were lousy paddlers, and Amelio did not have a clue what was
going on (he was not to good at english), but fun it was and wet we
were :) The pictures are available on <a
href="http://www.raft.co.nz/">raft.co.nz</a>.
</p>

<p>
We also saw the canyon swing that Catja wanted to ride: The world
greates swing, 109nm down the canyon). Did not look as scarry as we
thought it was.
</p>

<p>
After the rafting we packed the car and headed towards Milford
Sound. As we got nearer the destination it rained a lot, and we saw
more and more snow. So much for summer....
</p>

<p>
We ventured in and saw the "city". It is non-existing, there is a
cafeteria, a gas tank, a tourist information and the wharf. We then
went to the only accomodation where we hoped there was room. After
disturbing a couple in a tent to get their car moved (they were
engaged in private business when we arrived I think :) ), we got the
tent up. In the rain. It rains 5-7 meters a year in Milford Sound. You
notice that when yuo are there...
</p>

<p>
We had looked forward to eating a pizza in the restaurant in the
lodge, but they had closed :( Oh well, noodles is also a nice dinner
:)
</p>

<p>
We stayed at the Milford Lodge. Beautiful location, too much rain.
</p>

<h2>28/12</h2>
<p>
Shit. It rained _all_ night. And not just drops of water, but cats and
dogs. It was too much for the piggy-tent, so it rained down on Catja
and me most of the night. We got quite wet and slept extremely lousy
:( I should have slept on the front seats as I thuohgt of doing. But
in the middle of the night I was too tired, too cold and the outside
was too pitchdark and rainfull to venture out of my sleeping bag.
</p>

<p>
We did have a bit of sun in the morning thuogh. Just enough to pack
the tent down. The showers were also nice and warm!
</p>

<p>
We then went on a 2,5h sailing trip in the Milford Sound. Wow. Very
beautiful. A narrow sound with very high mountains on both sides. Very
majestic, and it did almost not rain. It was clouded though, but it
did not matter. Worth the trip down there
</p>

<p>
We then went back to Queenstown (same way back, the only opportunity),
6 hours drive. We stopped to have a snowball fight on the way on the
exit of the Homer Tunnel. Summer? Not here. In Queenstown we stayed at
Kawarau Falls Campnig again, as it was so nice.
</p>

<h2>29/12</h2>
<p>
Oh wee! Skydivnig time! Chris, Tina, Catja and I had booked a skydive
at 12:30. Nervous? Oh no, not at all :)
</p>

<p>
We waited a couple of hours at the airstrip, but they were soon
forgotten. We got some skydive-suits, goggles and a classic hat :) We
then got a harness and met our skydivnig instructors. The guy on my
back was Wade, a 2m high heavybuilt Australian.
</p>

<p>
We then packed ourselves into a very small airplane. Thre was nothing
in it, just the hull and a small mat. I guess it was 1m in diameter
and there was just enough room for the 8 of us. Scary as. We then
climbed quite quickly top 12000ft (3.6km) and got strapped onto our
instructors.
</p>

<p>
And then it was time!! Oh wee. Chris was the first to go, and it was
so unreal to see him disapear out of the plane. Woooosh and he was
gone. And then immediately after it was my turn, legs out and sit on
the ledge, head back towards the instructors chest, and
whoooooooooosh! Down it went. It was fucking wild!! Most of my
freefall w(45 secs) was through a cloud, but it did not matter, it was
extremely wild to go through the floating raindrops at 200 km/h. I was
totally mesmerized by the ground that was comming my direction at top
speed. I was thumbs-up and howling in joy all the way! The parachute
was then unfolded and we floated the rest of the way. What a view? So
quiet and so high up in the air. I did not really think about the guy
on my back. It was awesome!!! I can only recommend it!!
</p>

<p>
I was on a rush all the way towards Wanaka where we slept for the
night. The only problem was that my teeth hurt quite a lot, like I had
bitten directly into some ice. Probably because I was howling all the
way, and I got the cold wind in at 200+ km/h on them. Ouch. Took a day
or two before they were ok again.
</p>

<p>
Wanaka was nothing special. A lake, some bars and discos and a lot of
young men driving aruond in smart cars.
</p>

<p>
We stayed at the ?? Lakeview Camping in Wanaka.
</p>

<h2>30/12</h2>
<p>
Off towards Franz Joseph glacier, stopping at some falls on the way
(Fantail and Thunder Creek). We also stopped at the coast to see the
Ship Creek and Knights Point viewpoints. We then drove to Lake
Matheson, which should give a pictoresque view of the mountains of the
glaciers in the mirrorlike lake. Unfortunately there was too much
wind, so it was nothing special.
</p>

<p>
Franz Joseph is a very small town, that only exists because of the
nearby glacier. Nothing too it, except a supermarket, accomodation,
some bars and tour offices. We stayed at the Franz Joseph Holiday
Park.
</p>

<h2>31/12</h2>
<p>
Up early and off towards the glacier for Tina, Catja and I, on a full
day guided glacier hike with the Guiding Company. We were equipped
with boots with claws underneath and ice-axes, and hiked to the
glacier. It was a very weird experience to walk around on the
glacier. Many weird and beautiful ice landscapes. It was a bit boring
in the end though. We were 15 people, which was too many. A lot of
time was also spent waiting for the guides to create steps for us in
the ice so we could climb the ice. But it was worth it.
</p>

<p>
The main guide was called Tosh or Todd, and was quite cool. He was
planning on going to Antarctica as a guide for research
excursions. Coool.
</p>

<p>
And then it was nnew years evening. Us hikers were a bit dead after
walking for 6-7 hours. There was also some mix-ups because of our own
champagne and the bar area, so it ended up with Tina, Chris and I
having a quiet new years eve on a bench outside the bar on the camp
ground. Weird new years eve, but nice.
</p>

<h2>1/1</h2>
<p>
2004! Weird weird. We slowly packed our stuff and drove towards the
Pancake Rocks (Punakaiki). We saw a beautiful mirror lake on the way,
not quite Lake Matheson, but still very beautiful.
</p>

<p>
We found a nice camp ground with a tavern next to it, and right next
to the beach. We left the tents and then went and saw the pancake
rocks, which are weird limestone formation where the rocks looks like
they are made of pancakes on top of each other. Nature is weird (and
wonderful). There are also some blowholes where the sea splashes in
and creates wather fountains resembling geysers. It depends on the
tides though, and we where to lazy to walk up and see them.
</p>

<p>
Catja and I booked some kayaks for the day after so we could go
kayaking on the nearby river, which I had gotten recommended. We then
went to eat at the tavern. The food looked good, but what a wait!! We
had to wait 1,5h for the food. We were quite grumpy by then. The staff
could not care less. Oh well, we got our food. I got a "fishermans
basket"... I should have learned the lesson ni Seattle: Seafood should
be deepfried in some peoples minds -- yuck. Hmm, down it went though,
and it was not near as awfull as in Seattle.
</p>

<p>
Stayed at the Punakaiki Beack Park, Owen Rd.
</p>

<h2>2/1</h2>
<p>
Catja and I got down and fetched our kayaks, and went kayaking all
day. We had to go upriver, and that was hard but fun. Catja did the
classic turnover at one of the "rapids". It was a nice trip, but there
were too many places where we had to walk either becaus of too strnog
a current or to low water level. After 3 hours of kayaking we stopped
and had lunch.
</p>

<p>
After lunch we went back downstream. It was much more relaxed and
easy, and we had much more time to enjoy the beautiful view. In the
end I had to play smart and splashed water on Catja and tried to flee
sailing backwards. Of course I tipped over! Oh well.
</p>

<p>
All in all a hard but good kayak trip. I must have strained my right
hand thuogh. It felt funny for a couple of days after. Catja got quite
a sunburn on her thighs and bruises on the back. Adventure sports hurt
:)
</p>

<p>
In the evening we went and saw the blowholes. Next to me at some point
a good looking girl stands near me (the first ni a long time), and
what is she? Danish of course. Conclusion: My taste is danish :) Did
not get her number though :) On the way back we enjoyed a beautiful
sunset on the beach.
</p>

<h2>3/1</h2>
<p>
Of towards Picton (where the ferry leaves for the North Island). We
stopped at the Buller Gorge swingbridge and walked over it. Not too
interestning, but after a skydive nothing is :) We also stopped at
Cloudy Bay Winery on the way and tasted a bit of wine. Thay do make
nice white wine, and Catja and I bought a bottle for dinner.
</p>

<p>
Picton is a cozy little town with a nice little harbour, but that is
about it. We stayed at the Picton Holiday Pack. A cozy little camp
ground, with room for only 20-30 tents.
</p>

<h2>4/1</h2>
<p>
Up early and catching the ferry at 6 o'clock. Slept through most of
the passage.
</p>

<p>
In Wellington we checked in at the hostel and returned our little
piggyvan. I then took advantage of the free niternet on the hostel :)
We then went to see "The Return of the King" at the Regency
theater. We had bought "lounge tickets". It was only 28$ (~ kr 100),
and oncluded free soft drinks and popcorn and each of us had our own
Lazyboy seat. A huge soft hair with fold-up foot rest and plenty of
leg room. Recommendable. After the film we dined at Lone Star and went
to bed early as we had to be in the airport at 4:30am the next day to
get the plane to Australia.
</p>

<p>
Stayed at the Wildlife House, Tory Street.
</p>

<h2>5/1</h2>
<p>
Rise and shine at 3:00am :( Pretty dark outside. Packed our stuff and
called two cabs (we needed two for all our luggage). The plane ride to
Sydney went without drama, and I slept for a few hours. I thought I
had lost when I was seated right between two couples with
babies. Fortunately they were reseated to somewhere with more room :)
</p>

<p>
In Sydney we took a bus towards the suburb called King's Cross, as I
had heard that it should be "an exciting" part of Sydney. After a bit
of search we found a hostel. King's Cross certainely is a weird and
exciting place -- it has a sort of Istedgade feel to it.
</p>

<p>
After settling in at the hostel we went down to downtown Sydney,
walked around the Operahouse, saw the Harbour Bridge, etc. Very
touristy. We then bought tickets for a boat to the Toranga Zoo. While
waiting for the boat, who did we meet? Anne &amp; Kristina that shared
the house with Tina &amp; Catja in Wellington.... what is the chance
of running in to them in Sydney? They were also going to the
Zoo. Weird weird.
</p>

<p>
The zoo was nice and we saw a lot of wallabies, kangaroos, tigers,
elephants, etc. We also saw a platypus, never seen one "live"
before. One weird animal.
</p>

<p>
In the evening we sat and enyoyed the view from the roof terrace, and
the light show comming from the Harbour Bridge. 
</p>

<p>
Stayed at Sydney Central Backpackers, Orwell St. A bit scruffy
looking, but nice roof terrace with a view at the Harbour Bridge and
Operahouse. The room itself was incredible hot though, we were
sweating like pigs.
</p>

<h2>6/1</h2>
<p>
A bit lazy day, we spent most of the day planning the rest of the trip
and wandering a bit around the local area. We bought a package tour
from <a href="http://www.peterpans.com/">Peter Pan Travel</a>,
including a 3-day sailing trip in the Whitsundays and a 3-day tour on
Fraser Island. The total cost including bus ticket from Cairns to
Brisbane was around AU$440 (one AU$ is around 5 DKR). Quite cheap
cmopared to other prices we found.
</p>

<p>
In the evening we met up with Kristina and Anne and toured a couple of
bars that we were given drinks vouchers to (from the hostel). *hic*
</p>

<h2>7/1</h2>
<p>
After another very hot night in our room we went and got our tickets
for the rest of the journey, and then walked to downtown through the
Botanic Gardens. We then toured around central Sydney, and then back
to get to the airport.
</p>

<p>
We caught our plane without drama, except that my drinking back had
leaked and my daypack and contents was a bit wet. Everthing seems to
have survied though. We went with Virgin Blue from Sydney to Cairns, a
cheap airline company. If our flight was "normal standard" I can only
recommend that, I have never seen such a beautiful stewardess, and I
have certainely logged plenty of flying hours. Oh wee, Jessie,
kiwi-girl, around 20 I guess, and there must have been some polynesian
blood or something the like. It has been a long time since I have
followed the security briefings as closely as I did. I almost did not
wink :) (I was later to learn that KLM also has some beautiful
stewardesses...)
</p>

<p>
In Cairns we arrived at our hostel -- and boy, was that a nice hostel?
It was a resort-like hostel, with a nice pool right next to the bar
area. Each night they showed movies on a big screen, and you could
watch it from the pool with a beer in your hand. Not bad at
all. Moreover the rooms had good aircnoditioning, no bunk beds, 4
people pr. room, balcony, own fridge and sink. Quite the place, and
only for $18/night. The only minus was that it was a 20 minutes walk
from the town centre, but that did not bother us much.
</p>

<p>
We spent the night at the pool and crashed in early.

<p>
Stayed at Bohemia Resort.
</p>

<h2>8/1</h2>
<p>
To go see some people that Tina had met in New Zealand. We rented the
cheapest car that we could find. A nice little Hyundai Getz, with
aircon! We then drove out to find Tolga, where they lived.
</p>

<p>
Betty and Peter was two very nice australians that had a wildlive
refuge, where they cared for wildlife that had been hurt, most of the
time from car accidents. It was quite a little paradise they
had. Peter showed us their garden with so many different (fruit)
trees. I cannot remember any of them, as I had not seen most of them
before. I can remember one though: Brasilian Cherry. Weird but
fantastic small red fruit, both sweet and chili-like strong.
</p>

<p>
We also petted some of their "babies": A small possum, a wallaby and a
pademelon (also a kangaroo-type). Small cudly babies. As cute as
animal babies come.
</p>

<p>
After a chat and an australien meat pie, we headed back towards
Cairns. We drove past Lake Eacham on the way and had a
swim. Incredible clear water! We also stopped to see a "famous"
Curtain Fig Tree. Weird form of tree, hard to explain, pictures to
come.
</p>

<p>
Back in Cairns we decided to try our "free dinner voucher" at a place
called The Woolshed. I thought the place looked like a dump, and I can
really not recommend the free dinner offer that they have. I got
"chili con carne", which was a small portion of rice and an
infinitesimal amount of bad meat sauce. Oh well, the meals that you
could "upgrade to" from $4-6 looked good enough. Lesson learned. They
also sold us a beer offer, forgetting to say that it was only valid an
hour after we had arrived. Classic hustler trick.
</p>

<p>
After waiting for our beer, we went back to the hostel and hung around
in the pool.
</p>


<h2>9/1</h2>
<p>
Today we had booked a Great Barrier Reef tour. It was a full day on
the reef, 5 hours snorkeling at two locations. The reef was just as
beautiful as I remembered it. This time I also got to see a
shark. Weird to snorkel around and then see a shark... but we were
told that they were reef sharks, and were not harmful. I trusted the
information given, and so did the shark because it swam away :)
</p>

<p>
The trip itself was also quite cool, the boat was fine and there was a
big barbecue with plenty of food included in the price. One the way
back one of the crew, which called himself Elvis, entertained. He got
a bit on my nerve, but did finished of with some Didgeridoo (?)
playing, which was quite cool in fact. All in all a good trip. The
boat was called Osprey V, I have forgotten the company name. The trip
costed $95.
</p>

<p>
Last time I was snorkeling at the reef I forgot to put on sunscreen
and got awfully sunburned, so I was not going to do that mistake
again. So I applied plenty of sunscreen multiple times! But who was I
trying to kid? 5 hours of sun, in the water, with a quite white
back... Of course I got extremely sunburned again!! Auch. My skin
started peeling of a couple of days later... Next time I will wear a
t-shirt....
</p>

<p>
We spent the night at the pool again, watching a movie and eating
bbq. We also met four "jyder" that we chatted with. Tina went to twon
with them, but Catja and me crashed instead.
</p>

<p>
Back at our room, our new roommate was from Korea, and was quite hard
to understand. I did chat a bit with him though, and suddenly he asked
"do you like alcoholic drinks?". Oh well, yes. So I got a gift from
him, some korean ricewine... Nice of him, but I did not exactly know
how to react. I have not tasted it yet...
</p>

<h2>10/1</h2>
<p>
Up early again again to catch the bus to Airlie Beach. We took a cab
to the bus station. Only problem was that Premier (the bus company we
were using) had moved to another location... so we had to run to the
new location with all our stuff. Really nice stuff with a totally
sunburned back :( We caught the bus though.
</p>

<p>
The bus driver, Joe, driving the bus was quite a character! He talked
and talked, and was quite funny! Among other stuff he talked about the
movies that he would show: "The movies I will show are ... crap! I did
not choose them, and they are crap! Bugger!". He also introduced us to
the cities we stopped in. Cool dude. And he was not lying with regards
to the movies. I cannot remember the name of the first one, but it
surely was crap. The second was "George of the Jungle" -- not really a
good movie either. Besides that the trip was nice.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the hostel and checked in.  A nice room with
aircon. Seemed like a nice hostel, plenty of accomodation but it did
not seem crowded. There is also live music all nights, big dining area
and night club (M@ss). The night club theme must be quite like
Ibiza. Each night had some theme: Jelly Fight, Ibiza Foam Party, Wet
T-shirt contest, etc. We opted out :)
</p>

<p>
We had a few beers and some pizza with John (US) and Michael (DE) from
our room. I then walked around the small city. It is basically just
one main street, a beach were it (as usual) is not safe to swim, a lot
of bars and hostels, and an artificial lagoon. Very touristy, and
basically a waiting place for people going on Whitsunday sailing trips
(like us). I had a Copenhagen icecream (there is also a Andersen
icecream chain ...) and walked around the lagoon looking at the insane
amount of huge bats flying around in the night. I have never seen so
many bats.
</p>

<p>
We stayed at Magnum's.
</p>

<h2>11/10</h2>
<p>
The day we were going for a 3-day sailing trip in the Whitsunday
Islands. We had to meet at the boatafter noon, and I spent most of the
day untill then at an internet cafe. Peterpan's (out travel agency)
had internet for $1/hour. Pretty darn cheap.
</p>

<p>
We met up with the others at the boat, The Habibi, at 1:30pm. The crew
was: Mike - Skipper (AUS), Shane - deck hand/cook (AUS), and Emmy -
hostess (UK). The other on the boat were: Stefan &amp; Ursula (DE), Tobias
&amp; Sabina (DE), Herb &amp; Hannah (US/CA), Neil &amp; Rachel (UK), Jessica &amp;
Robin (AUS, ZA) and Avi (Israel). The boat took a maximum of 27
passengers, so we were quite lucky to be only 14! It would have been
pretty crowded otherwise. The trip itself was a package deal that
included the sailing, snorkeling gear, stinger suits and food.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving we got fitted with our "stinger suits": In the summer
on the coast of Australia you can meet some nasty creatures when
swimming around, poisonous jelly fish aka stingers. If you get stung
by these especially on your chest you will most probably die. So to
guard against these while swimming your wear a nice elastic and
tightfitting whole-body suit, a stinger suit. It makes you look quite
ridiculous, especially men. But rather that than die. It will not
protect your against sharks, but hopefully you do not meet them...
</p>

<p>
We got our own cabin, in the end of the boat. Catja got a bit
claustrophobic. Understandable, it was quite small and immensely
warm. But that's life on a boat I guess.
</p>

<p>
We just sailed a bit around and moored near an island, got some dinner
(included in the price and cooked by the crew) and had some
beers. Almost everybody went to sleep on the deck. Not because they
were drunk, but becaus it was so incredible warm in the cabins and you
could also lie on the deck and watch the stars.
</p>

<h2>12/1</h2>
<p>
I was awoken around 3 o'clock when it started raining. It was a bit
funny because we were all running around drousy and confused, trying
to find out what to do. We all went to our cabins eventually. But was
only down there for around 5 minutes. It was so hot hot hot, and
confined that I was sweating like a pig and got a bit
claustrophobic. So I went up on the deck again where it luckily had
stopped raining.
</p>

<p>
We were woken up at sunrise and could watch the beautiful sunset. We
then went for a morning snorkel in the water, with our stinger suits
on of course. The Great Barrier Reef goas all the way down to the
Whitsundays, so there are corals and load of fish in the water. The
corals was just as beautiful as in Cairns, and there were just as many
fish. The difference was that the fish here were _very_
inquisative. They got really close to you, and kept following you
around. After the snorkeling we had breakfast on the boat.
</p>

<p>
We then sailed to Whitsunday Island to see and stay a bit on Whithaven
Beach. Wow! What a beach! It looked just like a Bounty
commercial. Beautifully coloured and extremely clear water, white
white sand and on a small island with some bush on it. As and added
bonus, the sand was almost 100% silicide (?) which meant that the sand
did not get hot. Wow! Shane had warned us about "squeeky spiders"
hiding in the sand, and squeeking when you stepped on sand near
them. Good joke, it was the sand that sounded funny when you stepped
on it. He had us for a minute.
</p>

<p>
The only minus about the beach was that to go in to the water, you of
course had to have your stinger suit on. It looked so comical to watch
this incredible beach populated by people in tightfitting stinger
suits. :)
</p>

<p>
We had some nice hours on the beach, and we saw something that must
have been a ray in the water twice. The weather was also very hot and
sunny. A recommendable destination!
</p>

<p>
We then sailed to another location (Blue Bay something) and had
another snorkel. Again very beautiful! After two times snorkel with
not so good a mask I had collected around 0.5L of salt water in my
sinuses. After a couple of hours it suddenly started to run out of my
nose. Not just dripping, running! Very charming. Oh well, my sinuses
was cleaned. :)
</p>

<p>
We moored there for the night and spent the evening drinking a few
beers and story- and joketelling. Nice, funny and relaxed.
</p>

<p>
We slept on the deck again. I had borrowed a sleeping mat from Shane
this time though, so it was a bit more comfy. And there was no
"rain-wake up" this night.
</p>

<h2>13/1</h2>
<p>
Up at sunrise again and morning snorkel again. A aprt from the "usual"
beautiful corals and fish we also saw a turtle this time!! I almost
missed it because it was just sitting on the bottom, very still with a
bit of jelly fish in its mouth. We were just floating around and
watching us, and it was also just looking at us. After a while it took
off, with us on its tail :) After a while we lost it though. What a
cool animal. It looks like it is flying when it swims through the
water. Cool cool!
</p>

<p>
We then got back on board and cruised nice and easily back to Airlie
Beach. All in all it was a very good trip. Nice people, fantastic
weather and locations. The food and crew was also very good. I think
it would have been quite different with 27 on board though!!
</p>

<p>
Back at Airlie Beach I sent 10kg of winter clothes, hiking boots,
books, souvenirs, et.c. back to Denmark. Ahhh, my backpack got so much
easier handling. I then did one more internet session.
</p>

<p>
We had to catch the bus to Rainbow Beach at 10:40pm. Before that
however we met up with a lot of the others from the boat (incl. Shane
&amp; Emmy) on a bar called Chatz for food and drink. That was quite
funny, and we got somewhat drunk before getting on the bus. As our bus
left of and was driving down the main street Neil and Shane was
mooning us - the bus driver stopped and commented it :)
</p>

<p>
I fell asleep on record time and slept like a rock.
</p>

<h2>14/1</h2>
<p>
We arrived at Rainbow Beach at 2:40pm, checked in and then went to a
briefingabout the next couple of days. We had bought a "4x4 self-drive
camping package on Fraser Island". At the meeting we were briefed on
Fraser Island and 4x4 driving, etc. We then met up with the rest of
our group -- we were to be 11 people on each car.
</p>

<p>
The group was: Flora (NL), Lloyd and Rob (UK), Fiona, Mop (Camilla)
and Ian (UK), Kathleen and Kathleen (CA). Everybody seemed like nice
people! Funnily enough all of us (except the Kathleens)took the
courtesy bus to see the "Rainbow Sandblow" in the afternoon, without
talking to each other about it. So we must have been somewhat
likeminded. The Sandblow was nothing in particular though.
</p>

<p>
In the night we had dinner at the hostel. They had a $4 dinner, and it
was quite good in fact. Plenty of baked pasta! Good deal. I had a few
beers with Lloyd and Rob before turning in.
</p>

<p>
We stayed at Dingo's. Ok place, but a bit worn. And no aircon.
</p>

<h2>15/1</h2>
<p>
Rise and shine! The hostel had free pancakes at 7am, and since we had
to start packing the car, etc, at 8am why not get some free pancakes?
Nice deal, and there were plenty of pancakes.
</p>

<p>
At 8am we started checking the car and gear. The car was a Toyota
Landcruiser, with room for three in the front and 8 in the pack. All
luggage went on the roof, covered by a tarpaulin. After checking that
we had everything, food, tents, cudlery, etc. we got a brief intro to
driving the car, and then it was of towards the barge that was to take
os to Fraser Island.
</p>

<p>
I got the privilege of driving the first time, which went ok, but damn
the "roads" are shitty on Fraser Island. It was quite bumpy for the
ones sitting in the back. It was quite fun to drive around in winding
mud roads in a 4WD though.
</p>

<p>
We started by seeing "Rainbow Gorge" ... yawn, nothing special. We
then went inland and headed towards Lake MacKenzie. On the way it
started raining big time! It was pouring down "tropical style". We did
make it to the Lake though, and it was a quite beautiful lake -- even
though it rained a bit there too. The water was crystal clear
freshwater and we had a good swim.
</p>

<p>
After that we went t the "Dilli Village" camp site to put up our tents
for the first time. It went pretty good, no problems and the tents
were fine. We then cooked dinner and had some drinks. After that we
joined some of the many other groups camping the same place for more
drinking and singing. There was and Irish guy playing guitar, and
everybody tried to sing (including me). Quite fun. There were a couple
of Qustralians that sang some "sexual disease" songs -- I wish I could
remember them, they were quite funny. The "event" was closed down by
the rain...
</p>


<h2>16/1</h2>
<p>
It had rained all night, and it was still raining when we got up :( We
had a bit of luck though, as it stopped raining while we packed down
the tents. We then drove towards Indian Heads, and saw Eli Creek, The
Pinnacles and a shipwreck on the way. The Pinnacles especially was
very beautiful. We also got stuck in the sand a couple of times on the
way, and had to get out and push the car. But that is part of the game
on Fraser Island I think.
</p>

<p>
We camped at Indian Heads, on a "camp site" with no facilities at
all. No water, no toilets, nothing except quite a lot of sand
:). After putting up the tents we went for a walk to "The Champagne
Pools", which is the only place where you can swim in the sea on
Fraser Island. You cannot swim elsewhere because there are plenty of
Tigersharks swimming around in the sea surrounding the island. There
was not much champagne about "the champagne pools". They were quite
small and filled with algae, so I just went in to my knees and then
quickly up again. It was a nice view from Middle Rock though.
</p>

<p>
We ha a pretty quiet night, listening a bit to music from two Aussie
blokes camped nearby. They also gave a Tequila shot -- Tequila, eew,
it will never quite be my favorite. Before we went to bed we had a
visit from the camp ranger that talked abit about the dingos (the wild
dogs living on the island), frogs, etc. Quite interesting.
</p>

<h2>17/1</h2>
<p>
Up _really_ early again (what a vacation...). We got up at 4:30, so we
could walk up on Indian Head and look at the water at sunrise. Silly
thing to do, was it not for the good chance of seeing the sharks
feeding. We had no luck at all though. No sharks. The only thing we
saw was a ray.
</p>

<p>
Still a bit sleepy, we packed everything down and drove to Lake Allom
where it should be possible to swim with plenty of small turtles. We
saw some pretty huge spiders on the way and two giant monitor lizards
paid us a visit after we had eaten breakfast. The lake itself was
nothing special, and there were no turtles in the vicinity :( Flora
and I had a swim though in the green and not very clear water. At
least it was refreshing.
</p>

<p>
We then drove further south and walked for an hour to reach Lake
Wabby. Again nothing special but a nice lake, with more clear water
than Lake Allom. There were loads of fish in the lake though, and soon
as you entered the water they started nipping at your skin. Probably
feeding on dead skin. Quite funny, it did not hurt it just
tickled. Unfortunately it started raining (again again), so we walked
back and drove towards the barge.  We had lunch at the barge landing
site, and was watched closely by a dingo the whole time.
</p>

<p>
Side note: The entire trip Lloyd sang "A monkey rode my dingo .... he
rode it mighty fast" at least once every 20 minutes :) Apparently a
"song" he had learned from an irishman on the west coast of Australia.
</p>

<p>
Back at Rainbow beach we had to clean the car and check that we had
everything. We had somehow lost one cup and a peg bag... $1 per
person. The car was also checked to see if we had broken the springs,
which we luckily had not. It seems like it happens often for groups
though, and it costs a lot if they are broken.
</p>

<p>
Back at Dingo's we had a shower and a $4 meal again. Everybody was
quite tired, so everybody went to bed early.
</p>

<h2>18/1</h2>
<p>
Lazy day. We did nothing besides lying in the pool and swim at the
beach to kill the time untill we had to catch the bus to Noosa.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Noosa, checked in and went straight for the beach. At
dusk we went back to the hostel, and more or less went straight for
the bar :) And that was the start of a very drunken night. We had
heaps of beer, vodka/red bull, tequila, etc. Ouch. Later on we went to
the nearby disco, Reef Bar. We danced around very drunk, drank more
and had a waterfight. Which of these things it were I dont know, but
something pissed the staff off. A bouncer came up to me and said that
I had to leave, which I did not have a big problem with I just wanted
to know why. So he said "leave", I said "why?", and after three times
they more of less strangled me and carried me out. Thanks a lot! Was
that really necessary? I think not. I was very pissed (in two ways). I
could not do much about it though... Tina was also kicked out, a bit
less violently though, 5 sec. after I was.
</p>

<p>
After standing outside the door, steaming and behaving like a jerk, we
went back to the hostel and slept like babies. At some time during the
night I had managed to loose my room key, and use quite a lot of
money....
</p>

<p>
We stayed at Koala's. Ok place. A bit worn though, and somewhat of a
party hostel.
</p>

<h2>19/1</h2>
<p>
Slept most of the day. We got up around 1pm, just in time for me to
catch my "surf lesson" at 2pm. It was basic surfing instructions for 2
hours, and it was a lot of fun. I was up and standing on the baord,
trying to look cool at the end of the lessons. Fun fun fun! We hung
out at the beach afterwards.
</p>

<p>
At night we ate mexican food at the hostel ($7.5, good food), went to
bed early and read in our books. A very hard day :)
</p>

<h2>20/1</h2>
<p>
Up a bit earlier this day :) We walked to another beach (instead of
Main Beach were we had been the last couple of days), Sunshine
Beach. There were some quite nasty waves and a lot of undercurrent, so
much that it was not fun to swim in. And as soon as I had dried up,
put sunscreen on and had lied down on my towel it started raining! :(
So we took the bus home, did some internet, had dinner and went to the
cinema. We saw "Something's gotta give". An okay movie, but we felt
quite young compared to the rest of the crowd :)
</p>

<p>
We had _one_ nightcap at the bar before going to bed :)
</p>

<h2>21/1</h2>
<p>
We checked out in the morning and went to swim and sunbathe -- as
usual :) In the afternoon I went for a walk in the Noosa National
Park. Nice little park with nice beaches, forests, bush, lizards,
birds etc. I also saw one sleeping koala.
</p>

<p>
On the way back I thought about when I had had long trousers or shoes
on the last time. My normal "suit" is my bathing shorts and
flip-flops... except for the occasional rain it isaround 30 degrees
and sun. Ahhh :)
</p>

<p>
We then catched the bus first to Brisbane, and then to Byron Bay. We
arrived quite late (23:55), and was lucky that the hostel was still
open. We had booked through Koala, and they had obviously fucked
up. But there was room for us, so no drama.
</p>

<p>
Stayed at Backpacker's Inn. 40m to the beach, pool, big common room
with pool (and Galaga!), free bodyboards and free bikes. A very nice
place.
</p>

<h2>22/1</h2>
<p>
Walked to town and had brunch. After that we went to the beach all day
and played around with our bodyboards. Warm and fun. We had a sandwich
at the beach as dinner.
</p>

<h2>23/1</h2>
<p>
An extremely hot day. And for some reason I decided to walk to Cape
Byron. Hot hot hot. I was sweating like a pig. It was a nice walk
though, there are some very beautiful beaches on the way, the
lighthouse and location is pictoresque, and Australias most easterly
point is also on the way. Afterwards I relaxed in the shade in the
garden of the hostel. It was simply to hot to be in the sun.
</p>

<h2>24/1</h2>
<p>
Yet another lazy day :) Started with a bit of internet, and then
rented a surfboard for two hours to play on in the waves. Hmmm, it was
not exactly the "easy beginnerboard" that I had tried in my surf
lessons in Noosa. It took a while for me to get accustomed to it. Just
catching the waves was a problem. I did get a hang of it in the end
though, but I never really got to a nice stand. It was fun though,
except for my stomac that had gotten a slight sunburn the day before.
</p>

<p>
In the evening there was live music at the hostel. There was also some
from the audience that sang a song or two. Two blokes sang "Fuck her
gently" (Tenacious D.) :). I talked a bit with a Canadian who lived
right by Algonquin Provincial Park (where I was in Canada) .. the
world is small.
</p>

<h2>25/1</h2>
<p>
Up early again again. This time to go to Surfer's Paradise, the town
that we chose as "camp" for our visit to the themeparks. On arrival we
quickly checked in to our hostel, and then caught the bus to "<a
href="http://www.wetnwild.com.au/">Wet'n'wild"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Wet'n'wild was quite fun. Heaps of waterslides and other rides with
water. We had a quite fun day! There was also a pool where they showed
"Find Nemo" in the evening, but unfortunately the weather turned quite
bad in the evening so we decided to leave before that. A good
decision, as it _really_ started pouring down on the way back in the
bus.
</p>

<p>
Our original plan was to walk a bit around town, but the weather was
horrible. It was a really tropical downpour and storm. So we stayed at
the hostel. The hostel was a "weird" one, as it was in fact a hotel
that also had hostel accomodation. For $20 a night we had a 4-bed
dorm, but could use all the hotel facilities: Tennis, squash, spa,
pool, etc. Pretty good except that we were only staying one night :)
It was called Islander Hotel.
</p>

<h2>26/1</h2>
<p>
Next day, next theme park :) Today we went to <a
href="http://www.dreamworld.com.au">Dreamworld</a>. And boy was that
fun??? YESSIR! It was fun and exilerating! We tried: Cyclone, Vortex,
Tower of Terror, Giant Drop and Wipeout among others. The most scarry
was "Giant Drop", a ride up a 120 meters tower and then free falling
down. Oh weee. Took me some time to get myself together into doing
it. Put I finally did, and wow! The other rides were also quite
fantastic, but this one took the prize.
</p>

<p>
It was also "Australia Day", their national holiday, so I thought it
would be packed, but apparently australians do not go to theme pakrs
on that day, so the queue was almost always short for the rides. The
weather was also perfect, so we were quite lucky.  All in all it was a
a coool day there! Recommendable.
</p>

<p>
Back at Surfer's Paradise we ate dinner, and then caught the bus to
Brisbane. We just had time to watch the ending of "The Perfect
Storm".... just as bad as I remember it.
</p>

<p>
In Brisbane we checked into "Brisbane City Backpackers" on Upper Roma
Street. Very hot room, but otherwise a nice place. A lot of terraces,
a rooftop one also and a pool. They also had their own Irish Pub (with
pubquiz and all :) ).
</p>

<h2>27/1</h2>
<p>
Time to cuddle a koala :) Today we went to "Lone Pine Koala
Sanctuary", 30 minutes outside the city centre. We handfed some
wallabies/kangaroos/pademelons. Quite a life they had there. They
could just lie there in the shade while tourists kept going around
feeding them. I refused to feed them if they did not even want to take
a simple step towards me to get some food :) Catja and I also had our
photo taken while we were holding a koala. Cost a small fortune, and
the picture was crap... I was sweating sweat and sunscreen, I looked
sick. Oh well, I still cuddled the koala.
</p>

<p>
We also walked around the park and saw some of the other animals: a
lot of birds, wombats, a tasman devil, etc. Nice little "sanctuary",
but the animals were wiser than us, they were almost all of them
sleeping in the heat. Not to long befoere we left we got the chance of
hearing koalas "speak". They may look like the cutest animals on
earth, but they sound like pigs! Not a nice sound. Apparently it was
the males calling for the females.
</p>

<p>
After all the "animal petting" :) we walked around the city centre and
did a bit of shopping, and then hung out at the hostel.
</p>

<h2>28/1</h2>
<p>
Goodbye girls! This was the day that Tina and Catja went home to
Denmark again. So around 11am they took the shuttle to the airport,
and suddenly I was all alone in Australia. A bit weird in fact, as I
had been travelling with others for two months...
</p>

<p>
I spent the day by arranging the rest of my trip. First I went to the
Thai Airways office to get them to look at my ticket which had
suffered a bit my some of the weather conditions my backpack had been
through. It turned out to be no problem at all -- he had seen tickets
in much worse condition. But he put a nice little sticker on it, and
rewrote some of the details on it, so I was sure not to have trouble
with it at the airport.
</p>

<p>
I then found an internet cafe to plan the rest of my journey. The cafe
was very asian, I think I was the only white guy there, and there were
lots of asians eating noodle soup in a corner. Not the typical
australian atmosphere :) But I did get around to plan the rest of my
trip. I booked a return ticket to Koh Samui (island in the south east)
with Bangkok Airways online, departing 30/1 and returning 7/1. From
there it was my plan to take the boat to Koh Phangan (island next to
Koh Samui), to escape some of the tourist nightmare that Koh Samui
should be. I would then have around a week there, before going back to
Bangkok where I would have two days to shop and look around.
</p>

<p>
I thought a lot about what to do, thinking about a couple of days in
Chiang Mai, do some jungle trekking, then taking the train down south
see where I would end up, etc. But suddenly it occured to me that I
had no need for further exploration of nature and countries... I had
seen enough during the last couple of weeks. So off to a nice and
quiet island where I could just relax and do nothing.
</p>

After the rest of my journey was planned I walked abit around the
town, tried their harbour boat and saw the botanic gardens. I just
made it home to the hostel before the weather turned bad again. I then
had a quiet evening with a sandwich and a bit of TV watching
(Australian Open).
</p>

<p>
As I have come with comments about both canadian and new zealand
language, I should also comment on aussie-speak :) Problem is that I
do not feel that it is so much different from kiwi-speak. They are
equally fond of using mate and cheers, and I did not pickup any
ozzi-words. The pronounciation itself is close to kiwi-speak, but
still different. Cannot describe it totally, but especially "here" is
pronounce funny. It is more like "hearah".
</p>

<p>
So to catch the nationality from the countries I've been in, just ask
a person to say "We are about seven here" :)

<h2>29/1</h2>
<p>
My last day in Australia. I just hung out at the hostel, reading and
trying to wash my shorts as they were needing it. I remembered to take
them with me, all the way outside where I was waiting for the shuttle
for the airport. But as I realized on the way to the airport, I forgot
them there. Damn! Well, it was an excuse for me to buy the "board
shorts" or "boardies" that everybody in Australia wears, so I bought
them in the airport.
</p>

<p>
First I had to take the plane from Brisbane to Sydney. A nice
uninteresting trip. As I had not thought of telling the desk clerk in
Brisbane that I was continuing to Bangkok I had "the pleasure" of
carrying my bagage from the domestic to the international airport, and
paying for the train also. Damn! Well, got there in time, no problem.
</p>

<p>
The trip from Sydney to Bangkok was more interesting. It did not seem
like too long a flight as I was chatting a good deal of the time with
the girl sitting next to me: Dominique, an attractive and charming vet
from London. Good company.
</p>

<p>
Goodbye Dominique, good evening Bangkok! :) Bangkok airport looked
like itself, a bit dirty and full of touts. As I was leaving for Koh
Samui early next morning, I had decided to stay near the airport. It
would cost more than staying in the center, but I would not have the
hassle with a taxi to and from there. After I had tried to call some
of the nearby hotels I had seen in Lonely Planet with no luck, I
surrendered to a "official hotel reservation" desk. A bit more
expensive than I had planned on (B1800/night, approx. kr. 270), but
nearby and a place to sleep. It was called <a
href="http://www.ramagardenshotel.com/">Rama Gardens</a>.
</p>

<p>
As I arrived there I saw that I also got something for my money. It
was quite a big and nice place. Very classy looking. The room was very
big, had aircon, tv, etc. There was also pool, multiple restaurants
and a big garden at the hotel. Too bad I was only there for one night.
</p>

<h2>30/1</h2>
<p>
Up early again again again. I had breakfast at the hotel, and payed a
lot for it, but it was a nice big breakfast buffet. I then took the
free shuttle to the airport, checked in and was soon waiting for my
plane to Koh Samui. A nice little lounge to be waiting in, there was
free coffee, tea, fruit, juice and internet for everyone.
</p>

<p>
A little sidenote: It is amazing that you still need to carry tickets
around anymore. I did the booking online, and although they said they
needed a print of the confirmation email, they did not use much more
than my passport. The same with Vigin Blue and Quantas. Planetravels
are becomming easier.
</p>

<p>
The plane ride was smooth, and I arrived at Samui airport at 12pm. A
very small airport, with funny little "trains" to transport people and
luggage to and from the airport. I then caught a "limousine" (12-seat
aircon minibus packed to the limit) to "Big Buddha Pier" where I was
going to take the boat to Koh Phangan (Had Rin). Getting there I was
quite lucky, the boat was leaving at 1pm (the next one at 4pm, as far
as I remember).
</p>

<p>
The boat ride was smooth, and there I was: In Koh Phangan. As I wanted
to get away from people and just live somewhere close to the beach,
but still be able to get to a town in reasonable time my choice fell
on a "town" called Ban Tai (guided by Lonely Planet). I was soon
attacked by cab drivers, and after some waiting time while they were
trying to maximize profit by squeezing the maximum amount of people in
the car, I was one the way to Ban Tai. The "cab" was a pickup with two
benches on the back, and a roof for the luggage.
</p>

<p>
After 15 minutes the cab driver stopped in the middle of nowhere and
said that this was "Ban Tai". Oh well, me and two norvegian guys got
of, and headed for the beach (300 meters from the road). We arrived in
the middle of "Field Paradise Village" which had Bungalows for 200
Baht pr. night. As I was somewhat tired, and did not fancy walking up
and down the beach with my luggage I accepted for one night. The
bungalow was a bit scruffy looking with a lousy toilet and shower, and
I was moreover third row from the beach. Not quite what I had
imagined. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
After unpacking a bit, I went for a small walk on the beach and
discovered that right next door was what I was looking for. Bungalows
right on the beach, with much better ambiance and quality. After
walking some more to see what else was around, I went back to the
place next door and booked a bungalow for the day after. I then dozed
and read in a hammock on the beach for 3-4 hours. Aaaaaah.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon I chatted a bit with an australian guy called
Danny. Funny character. By looks he reminded me a bit of Mike Myers
(did not point that out to him). He had travelled quite a bit, also
around Europe. For the last couple of days he had been on Koh Phangan,
eating his share of "magic mushrooms". That may explain why he was a
bit stoned.
</p>

<p>
In the evening I had a few beers and dinner at the place with the two
norvegians (who had also decided to stay one night) and Danny. Another
reason for leaving the place was the chickens running around the place
(hmmm, was there something with a bird flu??).
</p>

<p>
I finished the night with a walk on the beach with the norvegians. As
we turned back the power on the whole island seems to fail. So it was
a dark dark bungalow to go to sleep in. I slept somewhat okay
though. Only awakened once when some animal bit me... part of the game
I guess.
