available on the [about page](http://beaufour.dk/about).

Running it locally
==================

    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    > cactus serve

Or really what you want to do:

    > pip install virtualenv
    > virtualenv .venv
    > source .venv/bin/activate
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    > .venv/bin/cactus serve

Generating image sprite
=======================

The sprite is generated by running `glue`:

    > glue icons --img=static/img/ --css=static/css/

Since I'm using `a` tags you need to edit `static/css/icons.css` and add `display:block` to the
generic sprite clause manually though.

Uploading
=========

To upload a new version run

    > .venv/bin/cactus/deploy

Known bugs
==========

* 404 page doesn't handle pages with directories in them, like `foo/bar`. To solve this I think
  you'd need to have Cactus use absolute paths instead of relative paths for static assets.
